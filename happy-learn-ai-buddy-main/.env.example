# HappyLearn CBC AI Buddy - Environment Variables
# ==============================================

# Client-side (Vite) - Required for frontend
# These are exposed in the browser bundle and should be public keys only
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# Server-side (Supabase Edge Functions) - Required for AI Tutor
# These are NOT exposed to the client and are used server-side only
# Set these in your Supabase project settings under Edge Functions secrets
# Navigate to: Dashboard > Project Settings > Edge Functions > Secrets

# LOVABLE_API_KEY is used by the ai-tutor edge function
# This is already configured in your Supabase project
# LOVABLE_API_KEY=your_lovable_api_key_here

# Note: If migrating to OpenAI directly, you would use:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key_here

# - All AI requests MUST go through the Supabase Edge Function proxy
# - The client NEVER directly contacts OpenAI or external AI services
