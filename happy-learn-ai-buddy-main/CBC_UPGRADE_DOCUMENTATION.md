# HappyLearn CBC Upgrade Documentation

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive upgrade to HappyLearn, transforming it into a CBC (Kenyan Competency-Based Curriculum) aware AI tutoring platform with enhanced progress tracking, improved chatbot personality, and robust Supabase integration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Supabase)

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/create_cbc_progress_tracking.sql`

Created two new tables with full Row Level Security (RLS):

#### `progress` Table
- **Purpose:** Track student learning progress across CBC curriculum
- **Columns:**
  - `id` (uuid) - Primary key
  - `user_id` (uuid) - References auth.users
  - `grade` (text) - CBC grade level (Grade 1-9)
  - `subject` (text) - Subject area
  - `questions` (int) - Total questions asked
  - `lessons` (int) - Lessons completed (1 lesson = 5 questions)
  - `streak` (int) - Learning streak in days
  - `last_active` (date) - Last activity date
  - `competencies` (jsonb) - Topic mastery tracking
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps

#### `chat_history` Table
- **Purpose:** Store chat conversations for review and continuity
- **Columns:**
  - `id` (uuid) - Primary key
  - `user_id` (uuid) - References auth.users
  - `grade` (text) - Grade context
  - `subject` (text) - Subject context
  - `messages` (jsonb) - Complete conversation
  - `created_at` - Timestamp

**Security:** All tables have RLS enabled with policies ensuring users can only access their own data.

### 2. CBC Curriculum Structure

**File:** `src/data/cbcStructure.ts`

Comprehensive Kenyan CBC curriculum data for Grades 1-9:

- **Grade 1-2:** Literacy, Mathematical, and Environmental Activities
- **Grade 3-6:** English, Kiswahili, Mathematics, Science & Technology, Social Studies
- **Grade 7-9:** Full CBC subjects with advanced topics

Each topic includes:
- Topic name
- Description
- Learning outcomes aligned with CBC

**Utility Functions:**
- `getSubjectsForGrade(grade)` - Get available subjects for a grade
- `getTopicsForSubject(grade, subject)` - Get topics for specific subject

### 3. Grade Selector Component

**File:** `src/components/GradeSelector.tsx`

Interactive component for selecting grade and subject:

**Features:**
- Dropdown selectors for Grade (1-9) and Subject
- Displays available topics for selected subject
- Compact and full-width modes
- Real-time subject filtering based on grade
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels

**Props:**
- `onSelectionChange(grade, subject)` - Callback on selection
- `initialGrade` - Default grade
- `initialSubject` - Default subject
- `compact` - Compact layout mode

### 4. Enhanced Progress Context

**File:** `src/contexts/ProgressContext.tsx`

**New Features:**
- CBC-aware progress tracking (grade, subject, competencies)
- Debounced Supabase sync (2-second delay to batch updates)
- Competency mastery tracking per topic
- Streak calculation with proper day counting

**API:**
```typescript
{
  progress: {
    questionsAsked: number;
    lessonsCompleted: number;
    learningStreak: number;
    grade: string;
    subject: string;
    competencies: Record<string, number>;
  };
  incrementQuestions: () => void;
  checkLessonCompletion: () => void;
  updateStreak: () => void;
  setGradeAndSubject: (grade, subject) => void;
  updateCompetency: (topic, mastery) => void;
  syncProgress: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- `useCallback` hooks for all functions
- Debounced database writes
- Automatic cleanup of timers

### 5. CBC-Aware AI Tutor (Edge Function)

**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-tutor/index.ts`

**Enhanced System Prompt:**
The AI now has a specialized CBC personality named "Happy" with:

- **Cultural Context:** Uses Kenyan examples (shambas, matatus, local markets, Kenyan wildlife)
- **Language Integration:** Incorporates Kiswahili phrases (Nzuri!, Hongera!, Vizuri sana!)
- **CBC Methodology:**
  - Inquiry-based learning
  - Real-world application focus
  - Competency-based approach
  - Critical thinking emphasis

**Technical Improvements:**
- Updated to use `Deno.serve` (modern Deno API)
- Proper CORS headers for all requests
- Receives `grade` and `subject` context
- Error handling with culturally appropriate messages
- Streaming response support

### 6. Enhanced Chat Component

**File:** `src/pages/Chat.tsx`

**Major Improvements:**

**UX Enhancements:**
- Textarea input with Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line
- Retry button for last message
- Auto-scroll to bottom on new messages
- Typing indicator with "Happy is thinking..." message
- Improved mobile responsiveness with proper height calculations

**CBC Integration:**
- Grade selector integrated into chat interface

- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper focus management

### 7. CBC-Aware Dashboard

**File:** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Redesigned Dashboard:**

**Top Metrics (3 cards):**
1. **Questions Asked** - Total questions with encouragement
2. **Lessons Completed** - Progress (1 lesson = 5 questions)
3. **Learning Streak** - Days with Kiswahili encouragement messages

**Main Sections:**

**Current Focus Card:**
- Shows active grade and subject
- "Continue Learning" CTA button
- Quick navigation to chat

**Competency Mastery Card:**
- Overall progress percentage
- Top 3 recent topics with progress bars

   ```bash
   # Migration already applied via MCP tool
   # Verify tables exist in Supabase dashboard
   ```

2. **Edge Function:**
   ```bash
   # Already deployed via MCP tool
   # Verify function exists: supabase/functions/ai-tutor
   ```

### Vercel/Netlify Deployment

1. **Environment Variables:**
   Set in deployment platform dashboard:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

2. **Build Command:** `npm run build`
3. **Output Directory:** `dist`
4. **Node Version:** 18.x or higher

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Debounced Sync?
Progress updates happen frequently (every question). Debouncing reduces database writes from potentially hundreds to one every 2 seconds, improving performance and reducing costs.

### Why Last 10 Messages Only?
Sending entire chat history to AI increases token usage and costs. Recent context (last 10 messages) provides sufficient conversation continuity while optimizing costs.

### Why JSONB for Competencies?
Flexible schema allows tracking any topic without database migrations. Easy to add new topics as curriculum evolves.

### Why Separate chat_history Table?
Keeps large conversation data separate from frequently-accessed progress data, improving query performance.

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

1. **React Performance:**
   - `useCallback` for all event handlers
   - `React.memo` considered for message components
   - Debounced scroll updates
   - Efficient state updates

2. **Database Performance:**
   - Indexes on `user_id` and `grade/subject`
   - Debounced writes (batch updates)
   - `maybeSingle()` instead of `single()` (no unnecessary errors)
   - Selective column queries

3. **Network Performance:**
   - Only last 10 messages sent to AI
   - Streaming responses (incremental display)
   - CORS properly configured
   - Compressed builds

## Security Measures

1. **Row Level Security (RLS):**
   - All tables protected
   - Users only access their own data
   - Authenticated access required

2. **API Key Protection:**
   - No client-side API keys
   - All AI calls via serverless function
   - Environment variables properly scoped

3. **Input Validation:**
   - TypeScript type safety
   - Database constraints
   - Sanitized user inputs

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. Competency mastery calculated manually (not auto-tracked by AI)
2. No teacher/parent dashboard
3. No offline support
4. Single user sessions only

### Suggested Enhancements:
1. **AI-Driven Competency Tracking:** AI automatically assesses mastery from conversations
2. **Parent Dashboard:** View child progress and learning patterns
3. **Achievements/Badges:** Gamification for motivation
4. **Voice Input:** Speak questions instead of typing
5. **Offline Mode:** PWA with local caching
6. **Multi-Subject Sessions:** Switch subjects within same chat
7. **Peer Collaboration:** Study groups and shared sessions
8. **CBC Assessment Integration:** Official CBC assessment preparation

## Maintenance Notes

### Updating CBC Structure:
Edit `src/data/cbcStructure.ts` to add/modify grades, subjects, or topics. No database migration needed.

### Modifying AI Personality:
Edit system prompt in `supabase/functions/ai-tutor/index.ts` and redeploy edge function.

### Database Schema Changes:
Create new migration file with proper naming: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
